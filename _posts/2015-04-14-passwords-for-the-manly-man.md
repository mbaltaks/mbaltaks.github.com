Easy to remember, hard to crack, and manly as anything. (But anyone is welcome to use them).

Best used with something like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com), [KeePass Password Safe](http://keepass.info) or [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword).

This post inspired by [Edward Snowden on Passwords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc).
