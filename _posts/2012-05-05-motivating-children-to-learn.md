Robert X. Cringely finishes this piece with:

> The only solution I can see is one teacher per student. And the only way something close to that is going to happen is through technology. And itâ€™s coming.

I'm fascinated with how new technology is used in schools, because kids don't pull any punches or make excuses. When something doesn't work right, or isn't useful, they just drop it immediately, and when something *does* work, well, then you can't pry it out of their hands. So personally I think a good way to see which new technologies will stick around for a while is to watch what kids are continuing to use.
