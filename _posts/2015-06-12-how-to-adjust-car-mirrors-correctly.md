I am astounded that I've never come across this before. It really does eliminate the blind spot.

Passing cars on the M7 today, I watched as the car was visible in my side mirror *before* it was gone from my eye sight, and then appeared in the rear mirror before it was gone from the side mirror. Great for road safety.

Take ten seconds next time you drive your car and fix your mirrors.
