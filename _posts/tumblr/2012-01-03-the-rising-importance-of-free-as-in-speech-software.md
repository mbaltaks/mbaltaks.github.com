<blockquote>
  The crux of the matter here is that unlike the days of yore,
  where repressive regimes needed elaborate networks of secret
  police and informants to monitor communication, all they need now
  is control over the software and hardware we use. Our desktops,
  laptops, tablets, smartphones, and all manner of devices play a
  role in virtually all of our communication. Think youâ€™re in the
  clear when communicating face-to-face? Think again. How did you
  arrange the meet-up? Over the phone? The web? And what do you
  have in your pocket or bag, always connected to the network?
