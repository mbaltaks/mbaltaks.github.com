The Secret History of Kim Jung Il -- written by one of his high
school teachers</a>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never returned to North Korea, and I never saw my family
  again. A few years later, I heard from a well-placed South Korean
  minister that my family had been sent to a gulag and murdered,
  the innocent victims of my treasonous crime. To this day, I know
  nothing of the details of their deaths, or whether they blamed me
  as they perished.</p>

  <p>I ache when I imagine what Kim Jong Il did to my family. So
  many times, I’ve imagined killing him and then killing myself.
  Countless days and nights I have pounded my chest with guilt and
  grief, unable to forgive myself for the ghastly fate that I have
  brought my beloved wife — my lifelong companion — our daughters
  and son, their spouses, and even our dear grandchildren.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he was still able to forgive.</p>
