<blockquote>
  Piracy is when people use violence, or the threat of it, to
  transfer your possessions to themselves (after which you no
  longer have them).
</blockquote>

Of all the discussion about SOPA I’ve read, this piece stood out
to me.

The way I see it, in order to continue making things, people
need a way to get paid for making those things. If the public is
choosing to use the things you make without providing any payment,
if you can’t work out how to earn money from the things you make,
then you have a problem.

But it’s not piracy.
