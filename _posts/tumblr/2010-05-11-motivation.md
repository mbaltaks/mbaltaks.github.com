<p>I read an <a href=
"http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2010/05/how-and-when-to-motivate-yours.html">
article about motivation</a> the other day, and I realised that I’d
already discovered his main finding for myself.</p>

<p>I’ll get home and I’ve planned to go to the gym, but of course I
don’t really feel like going today. So, since I always do a full
session at the gym, I trick myself by thinking “I’ll just get my
gym gear on, get over there and do 10 minutes on the treadmill,
easy”. So I get there, and do some treadmilling, then just one more
exercise, then just one more, and before I realise I’ve done a full
session at the gym.</p>

<p>So then next time, since I always do a full session at the
gym…</p>
