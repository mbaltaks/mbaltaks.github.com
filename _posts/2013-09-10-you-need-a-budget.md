I really like the approach this site takes towards planning and keeping a budget, and I think the approach works with all kinds of planning, because a big part is realising that plans change as time goes on, and you have to constantly revisit the plan. Without that, plans are just a fantasy you throw away as soon as you start working on what you originally planned.
