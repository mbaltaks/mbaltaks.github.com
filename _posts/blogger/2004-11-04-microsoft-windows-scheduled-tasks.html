Give me cron!

<br />Windows Scheduled Tasks are a pain, and I think the worst part is trying to get useful error messages out when things go wrong. Windows scheduler calls the return codes "Last Result" and displays in hexadecimal form, like 0x3. I found that you can try C:\net helpmsg 3 at the command prompt to get some idea of the error codes, but this won't work for all codes.
