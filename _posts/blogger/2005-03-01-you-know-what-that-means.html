"So if you're a filmmaker and you have a great new documentary film you want to make available on the internet, if you post it on your web site and it becomes successful, then you go bankrupt. If you can use peer-to-peer to distribute it, you can shift the cost of distribution to the recipient. So this infrastructure becomes essential to a certain kind of creativity in the future. Whether that's going to be possible in the future is going to turn on what the Supreme Court does."
