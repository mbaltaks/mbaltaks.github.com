title: The best Mac Terminal services (remote desktop) client

I've just found the absolute best Mac client for Microsoft RDP (remote desktop protocol) or terminal services, an app called CoRD (http://cord.sourceforge.net/). The clipboard works both ways, it's a native universal binary app, and the keyboard just works, even ctrl+alt+delete gets through. Much better than X11 wrappers around rdesktop. It looks like it imports saved files from the Microsoft Remote Desktop connection app as well.
