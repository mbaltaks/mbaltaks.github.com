<div class='post'>
I borrowed my sister's car last week, and put a CD in the player as I left the house. What I noticed as I drove off was a really distracting flashing from the CD player - it was complaining about something to do with the CD, and it was flashing the error message continually. It was actually a bit dangerous because it was distracting from the driving.<br /><br />But it wasn't until later that I realised what the problem was - it was a copy protected CD, and therefore not a compliant audio CD. It seemed to have a broken data portion of the disk that the car CD player didn't like and so was complaining about.<br /><br />I can't believe that with all the safety efforts that go into cars, a broken CD can cause such a problem, and that music labels are still ok shipping broken CDs.</div>
