This little story from David Smith is a great example of one of the many creative solutions that any software project needs.

> As with all great thoughts, while taking a shower I came up with an interesting alternative in the meantime. I got to wondering which values get truncated and which do not. It turned out that not all values greater than 10k get shortened, any number that happens to include two 1 digits is shown in full. So that led me to the workaround solution that will be shipping in version 1.1.1.

Because this is a creative solution that came while taking a shower, it also demonstrates why [great software takes time](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html).
