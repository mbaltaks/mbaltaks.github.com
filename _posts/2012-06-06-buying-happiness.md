> Despite popular assertions to the contrary, science tells us that money can buy happiness. To a point.

I've noticed that I've naturally gravitated towards the kind of thinking expressed in this article over time.

I'll wait and do without something until I can afford good quality, which means I appreciate it when I get it, or even realise that I don't really need it at all. Which means fewer things to own and store, but a more enjoyable experience using the things I do have. And then more money to spend on experiences.
