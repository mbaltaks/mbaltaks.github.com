Manuel Chakravarty presented an excellent talk last month about Functional Programming, and how the Swift language fits into that world.

I've been unable to fully wrap my head around this topic for years, and I felt like I was missing something. So I was extremely grateful to have someone with his expertise explain that there is no single definition of what Functional Programming is, but rather that there are a whole set of techniques and technologies that can be useful to improve software quality. And after talking to him last night, I'm going to try learning a little Haskell, just to start rewiring my brain so I can write better software myself.
