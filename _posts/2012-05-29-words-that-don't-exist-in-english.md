I love the difference in languages around the world. I particularly love that there exist words for some excellent concepts, such as Meraki and Taarradhin. And there are entire stories which are basically just a case of Arigata-meiwaku, where in Japanese that one word is enough. Of course, you might experience Yoko meshi while reading this article. Which you should do.
