What I find amazing about this is that someone hired this person, and let them hang around for two months before actually realising they had no idea how to do the job.

**Update:** This might well be a joke, but while we're laughing we're also cringing a little inside, thinking about the times we've worked with people who were not quite as obviously under-qualified.
