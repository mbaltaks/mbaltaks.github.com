Ok, I've recently come across this [Programmer Competency Matrix](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm) so I'm going to rate myself today, and it'll be interesting to come back and compare at a later date.

<table>
<tr><td>data structures</td><td>Between level 1 and 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>algorithms</td><td>Level 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>systems programming</td><td>Between level 1 and 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>source code version control</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>build automation</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>automated testing</td><td>Level 1, quickly on the way to level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>problem decomposition</td><td>Between level 2 and 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>systems decomposition</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>communication</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>code organization within a file</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>code organization across files</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>source tree organization</td><td>Between level 2 and 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>code readability</td><td>Level 2, and I think I need to seriously be more disciplined here</td></tr>
<tr><td>defensive coding</td><td>This one varies wildly from project to project depending on the scope and risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>error handling</td><td>Mostly level 2, level 3 where it really counts I think</td></tr>
<tr><td>IDE</td><td>Level 3 I guess, I like simple tools I can master</td></tr>
<tr><td>API</td><td>Well, this depends on which system I'm using right now! But in general I'm probably a level 1 for my most often used platforms, and I'm looking forward to going deeper in some specific areas</td></tr>
<tr><td>frameworks</td><td>If this is talking about incorporating third party libraries, then level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>requirements</td><td>I think level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>scripting</td><td>Just scraping into level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>database</td><td>Level 3 for sure</td></tr>
<tr><td>languages with professional experience</td><td>Probably only level 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>platforms with professional experience</td><td>I think level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>years of professional experience</td><td>Level 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>domain knowledge</td><td>This can only be evaluated for a specific project</td></tr>
<tr><td>tool knowledge</td><td>I guess level 2, maybe 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>languages exposed to</td><td>Ah, here maybe level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>codebase knowledge</td><td>Again, project specific, but I have certainly got up to speed on existing codebases pretty quickly several times</td></tr>
<tr><td>knowledge of upcoming technologies</td><td>These days I'm more at level 1 or 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>platform internals</td><td>Generally I think level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>books</td><td>Quickly getting to level 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>blogs</td><td>I think level 3, what do you think?</td></tr>
</table>

So that's me at this point in time, and thanks to [Graham Lee](http://blog.securemacprogramming.com/2011/04/on-my-own-competency) for linking to the matrix which prompted me to do so as well.
