You're wondering who I am. You already know my name, and what I find interesting, but here's a little extra.

I write software, and I've done so for companies such as Citrix and Vodafone, and now for my own company [Code Monastery](http://codemonastery.com.au/). Recently most of my work has been for [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/), sometimes backed by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). There are examples of some of my publicly available work on the [projects](/projects) page.

I'm on Twitter as [@mbaltaks](http://twitter.com/mbaltaks) and via email as "m" at this domain. I also usually have the username mbaltaks if I'm signed up to a particular service.
